	* how many different change combinations can you provide, assuming you have an infinite number of bills of each value? 
	* For example, to give a change of $15, you can have 6 combinations to form this change:
	* $1 * 15 = $15
	* $5 * 1 + $1 * 10 = $15
	* $5 * 2 + $1 * 5 = $15
	* $5 * 3 = $15
	* $10 * 1 + $1 * 5 = $15
	* $10 * 1 + $5 * 1 = $15
